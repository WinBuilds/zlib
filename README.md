# zlib - Data Compresstion Library

zlib 1.2.11 is a general purpose data compression library.  All the code is
thread safe.  The data format used by the zlib library is described by [RFC1950](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1950) (zlib format), rfc1951 (deflate format) and rfc1952 (gzip format).

All functions of the compression library are documented in the file `zlib.h`.
